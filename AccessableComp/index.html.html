        <div class="reflection">
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
            <p>1. Exit application popups vary in complexity across different applications. In Minecraft (PC), the exit popup includes multiple settings and graphics options, requiring both mouse and keyboard interactions for navigation. Word features a simple "Save" or "Don't Save" exit popup, though selecting a save location adds some complexity. Photoshop presents a straightforward "Yes," "No," or "Cancel" dialog, navigable via mouse or keyboard. All three applications allow interaction through multiple input methods, though complexity varies depending on the task.</p>

            <p>2. In Minecraft (PC), Photoshop, and Word, exit popups rely on both the mouse and keyboard for navigation, with arrow keys and Enter used for selection. However, there is no drag-and-drop functionality. In Photoshop and Word, the exit pop-up appears when clicking the X button on the screen. While there is a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + F4) to close the application, it is not commonly used or easily remembered. In contrast, Minecraft (PC) allows users to access the exit popup menu only by pressing the Esc key, making it a more straightforward and intuitive shortcut for exiting the game.</p>

            <p>3. In terms of learnability, the Minecraft (PC) exit popup becomes more intuitive with familiarity, though the complexity increases with advanced settings. Word’s simple popups are easy to understand, with the save location dropdown adding minor complexity. Photoshop’s popups are clear and efficient.</p>

            <p>4. Regarding accessibility, Minecraft (PC) and Word support both mouse and keyboard navigation, with Minecraft requiring more steps for menu navigation and Photoshop offering precise control for detailed settings. Photoshop provides the most accessible experience with simple, efficient popups – with only 3 options – that support both input methods.</p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Focus Order Considerations:</h3>
        <p> Minecraft (PC): Exit popup is entirely driven by arrow keys and the Enter key, with clicking sounds when a button is selected. Focus order follows the navigation of the popup options.</p>
        <p> Photoshop: Mouse-driven and keyboard navigation through menu.</p>
        <p> Word: Mouse-driven, accessible with the keyboard</p>

        <h2>Part 3: State Models & Component Redesign</h2>
        <h4>These state models explore the experience of mouse and keyboard users separately.</h4>

        <h2>Part 4: Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The original Minecraft exit popup had too many options, making navigation difficult for keyboard-only users (arrow keys + Enter).</li>
            <li>Photoshop and Word had clearer button labels and keyboard shortcuts but lacked strong focus indicators.</li>
            <li>I redesigned the Minecraft popup to show only three main options: “Back to Game,” “Settings,” and “Exit to Menu,” reducing cognitive load.</li>
            <li>Selecting “Settings” reveals additional options, keeping the main menu simple.</li>
            <li>Added a visual highlight to show which button is selected, improving usability for low-vision users.</li>
            <li>These changes make the interface more efficient and accessible, especially for motor-impaired and screen reader users.</li>
            <li>Prioritizing keyboard navigation ensures users who cannot use a mouse can still interact easily.</li>
            <li>My redesign solves a mismatch by simplifying navigation for motor-impaired and low-vision users, making the Minecraft exit popup clearer and more intuitive.
                By reducing options to just three core choices and adding a visual highlight for selected buttons, the interface becomes easier for low-vision users to navigate.
                Prioritizing keyboard navigation instead of relying on the mouse makes the popup more accessible for users with motor impairments, improving usability without sacrificing functionality.</li>
        </ul>
